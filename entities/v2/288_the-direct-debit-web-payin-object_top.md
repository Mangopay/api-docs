**A `PayIn` by direct debit and via web** is a request to process a payment to a wallet for a dedicated user.
* There is no possibility of recurring payment for the moment with SOFORT and GIROPAY. These payments are available only for Germany.
* **Please use the testing accounts described here [testing rules](/guide/testing-payments). If you use your own account even in sandbox you will actually be debited!**

An  `UBO Declaration` is an electronic version of the previous KYC document "Shareholder Declaration", in order to declare all the Ultimate Beneficial Owners of a BUSINESS-typed legal `User` (ie the shareholders with >25% of capital or voting rights).

1. Create an UBO Declaration for your legal user.
2. Declare your [entity_link entity="208"]`UBOs`[/entity_link] (ie. Ultimate Beneficial Owner that owns more than 25% of this company or the legal respresentative in case of you don't have UBO). 
3. Edit the UBO Declaration object and set the `Status` field to "VALIDATION_ASKED" (instead of "CREATED")
4. The demand is received by our team and once processed, it will either get a
								 - "VALIDATED" status: if all other required parameters and KYC documents are validated, the user will pas on the `KYCLevel` REGULAR
								 - "INCOMPLETE" status: complete the  `UBO Declaration` or create a new one
								 -  "REFUSED" status with more information provided in the `Reason` and `Message` parameters

Once your UBO declaration submitted, you will not be allowed to modify it. Our compliance team will analyse your declaration and will REFUSE it, VALIDATE it or mark it as INCOMPLETE with a `Reason` and a `Message.`

- REFUSED is a final status, your declaration is wrong and you have to recreate a new declaration
- VALIDATED is a final status, your declaration is correct. If your UBOs change you should recreate a new declaration
- INCOMPLETE is not a final status, there is some mistakes in your declaration and you can modify it before ask a new validation

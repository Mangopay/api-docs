Once setup, hook notifications allow us to make a request to a specific URL on your server to make you aware of various Events (such as a failed PayOut). You can set up one URL for each `EventType`. Here are the rules:
* After 100 failed notifications for an `EventType` (we couldn’t reach your URL), the hook will be automatically set to `Validity`="INVALID" and `Status`= "DISABLED".
* Every 10 failed notifications you will receive an email warning you of the issue.
* Each time you have a successful notification, we reset this counter (so if you have 99 failures, then 1 successful and then 1 failure, this won’t result in the 100 failed email alert)
* Changing the URL for a hook will not reset your failure count though
* The URL that we hook **must respond with a 200 status code within 2 seconds** – otherwise we will consider the hook a failure
* You are **strongly advised** to do a GET on the resource to check its Status (to ensure the Event is still relevant, but also to ensure the hook is authentic)
* You can also view and manage your Hook notifications from the new MANGOPAY Dashboard. You have the possibility to test the hook to see if it is working well. Note that when setting up a new hook, then when saving it a test is launch automatically
* We are currently **unable to send hooks to servers that accept only TLS 1.2** (in sandbox this is possible, but not in production) - we will improve this in the future, but we do not yet have a date confirmed
* You must use a trusted SSL certificate - **self-signed certificates are not supported**

**Notification format:** ...your-site.com?EventType=`EventType`&RessourceId=`RessourceId`&Date=`Timestamp` 

Where the `RessourceId` is the `Id` of the object in question.

[alert type="info"]Note that in the URL parameters, `RessourceId` has two "s", and not one as in the API objects - this is a mistake and will be corrected in a future API version[/alert]

**Example:**
If you want to create a notification for the event type "KYC_SUCCEEDED" on your URL: "http://www.mynotificationurl.com" you will recieve this ping: http://www.mynotificationurl.com?EventType=KYC_SUCCEEDED&RessourceId=1309853&Date=1397037093

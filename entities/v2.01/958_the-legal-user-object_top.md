A `Legal User` represents a business or an organization whereas a natural user is a person. This legal user is able to:

* process payments
* transfer e-money between wallets
* withdraw e-money from a wallet
* create wallets, etc.

Please refer to our [KYC Rules](/guide/kyc) in order to find out more about procedures and authentication levels.

[alert type="info"]Please note that we recently changed the required information to do the regular validation of a `Legal User` type business. We now ask you to declare the `CompanyNumber` and to post an `UBOs declaration` instead of the manual shareholder declaration.    [/alert]

You need to create document in order to upload pages on this document.

1.  The `KYC Document Object` is a request to validate a required document. There is one request for one `Type` of document
2.  Upload a file through a `[entity_link entity="208"]Page[/entity_link]`. A document should get several pages
3.  Edit the object Document and set the `Status` field to "VALIDATION_ASKED" (instead of "CREATED")
4.  The demand is received by our team. The object is waiting for a "VALIDATED" status

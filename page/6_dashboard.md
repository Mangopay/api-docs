In the Dashboard menu you will be able to see the “Latest updates and news” regarding the new or updated features of our API. You have also access to the same news via our [site](/blog/).

At the top of all pages, you are able to search for objects IDs (users, transactions, cards, wallets).


**USER MENU**

Going back to the User’s list of transactions, you can click on the magnifying glass icon for each one to see the full details of the transaction. Let’s take a successful payin as example.

If you want to refund this payin you can click on the “Refund” button.
You are then redirected to the “Operations” menu, with the fields prefilled, since you accessed it through the “Users menu”:

You can also of course go to Operations directly and do the actions that you require, by filling all the parameters in yourself:

*Tip operation : You can access the operations through the user’s menu, that will allow you to access the operation menu but with prefilled fields.*

**NOTIFICATION MENU (MOSTLY USED BY DEVELOPERS)**

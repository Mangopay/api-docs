# 3DS 2.0

We currently use two protocoles to authorise your payments:
* Direct Autorisation: we send the payment request without any authentication. 
* 3DS 1.0 server: we force a redirection of the user to their issuing bank where they need to authenticate themselves, generally through the SMS-OTP (One-Time Password). 
The choice between one route or another is based on specific rules. These two routes are very binary with no intelligence. 

Due to the new requirements for online payments, the  [regulation](https://docs.mangopay.com/guide/dsp2-and-3ds-20)  has required the industry to adapt the 3DS  protocol to: 
* Take into account the exemptions which allow frictionless payments (payment without strong customer authentication)
* Provide a mobile-friendly authentication method to improve user experience

This new version is called the 3DS 2.0. In the medium term, it will become compulsory for all card payment transactions. In other words, we won't be able to route a payment directly to authorisation. MANGOPAY will manage all of the connections for you.

## Exemption management and Frictionless experience

The 3DS 2.0 server takes into account the exemption requests permitted by the PSD2. Whenever an exemption is accepted, the cardholder will pay without having to complete an SCA. This is called the Frictionless Payment experience.

#### How does the frictionless experience work?

As of today, MANGOPAY enable you to:
* Force Strong Customer Authentication on each transaction with the parameter `SecureMode = FORCE`
* Set a limit under which we will request an exemption for you. At the moment, the default limit is 50 euros. As part of the PSD2, we will downgrade the limit to 30 euros by default. If you have a custom limit you may be affected by a downgrade. We will contact you individually to explain the impact and the planning. 

Under the configured limit, MANGOPAY will use the available information to select the best exemption. 
* If the issuing bank accepts, you will benefit from a frictionless experience where your user is directly redirected to the payment confirmation page.
* If the issuing bank refuses, your user will have to complete an SCA.

#### How to maximise my exemption rate ?

The PSP or acquiring bank must justify the exemption by providing sufficient data to the issuer (i.e. the cardholder’s bank). 
We will therefore release new fields on our card Payin endpoints for you to complete. Use these fields to maximise your exemption rate.

*N.B. MANGOPAY will keep its clients updated on the new parameters.

#### How can I do transactions while the payer is offline ? 

As explained in the [PSD2 article](https://docs.mangopay.com/guide/dsp2-and-3ds-20),  the transactions taking place when the payer is offline are not in the scope of the regulation. This is called a Merchant Initiated Transaction (MIT). In many known use cases, a payer card is registered and debited recurrently:
* Subscription: One time card registration and a debit at a regular frequence 
* Rental: You take a deposit at the reservation and the rest of the amount at the end of the rental period 

For these cases, the industry's new standards strictly require the SCA during the card registration.
We will release a new feature to guarantee all offline transactions. The feature will force SCAs at the card registration and link all payments to the original SCA thanks to a token system. All cards registered before this new feature will get a default token, this will guarantee a continuity of service.

## UX improvements 

New authentication methods through new technologies will be setup. They will be available without any redirection and included in updated mobile-friendly SDKs by MANGOPAY, expected at the end of 2019. They will improve the user experience by avoiding a redirection to the issuing bank’s page and allow new authentication means such as:  
* Biometry on mobile
* In-banking app authentication

Please note that the implementation of these new authentication methods depends on each issuing bank.

## 3DS.2.2 - The future of 3D Secure

Following the adoption of 3DS 2.0 by European payment institutions, 3DS 2.2 is expected to replace 3DS 2.0. As part of this change, we expect the SMS-One time password to come to an end by the end of 2021 due to the fact that it is not officially recognised as an SCA. 

3DS 2.2 is expected to bring: 
* Additional device compatibility
* Improve the exemptions' management: enable trusted beneficiaries and improve risk analysis thanks to additional payment parameters
* Enhanced user experience within the banking application authentication (out of band)

MANGOPAY’s roadmap is described below.

## The next steps

#### For the Industry
The 3DS 2.0 is a major change for the industry and it will take some time for all actors to adapt to the changes and connect to the 3DS 2.0 servers. Therefore, most regulators have published transition plans in order to boost the switch without harming the industry:
* The BAFIN (German regulator)[declaration](https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Pressemitteilung/2019/pm_190821_PSD2_Kundenauthentifizierung.html;jsessionid=B91CA471E1FC2F63DC6688D7A4A7D2CE.2_cid390) 
* The FCA (British regulator) [declaration](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-agrees-plan-phased-implementation-strong-customer-authentication)
* The EBA (European Banking Authority) [declaration](https://eba.europa.eu/-/eba-publishes-an-opinion-on-the-elements-of-strong-customer-authentication-under-psd2)

#### For MANGOPAY

At the moment, similarly to all payment industry actors, we cannot guarantee that your transactions will be handled with 3DS 2.0. Some banks have announced significant delays which block our implementation. Once the transition period is over, we will be able to route 100% of the card payments to the new 3DS server and manage all of the necessary exemptions.

In the meantime, MANGOPAY will continue to guarantee your payments thanks to a “smart routing” tool. This tool will enable us to choose the best path for your payments: 3DS 2.0, 3DS 1.0 or direct autorisation.

#### For you: 

Most of the work for 3DS 2.0 will be done by MANGOPAY. Indeed, as your unique interface to the banking network, we will do all the connections and exemptions management for you. 

However, to make the most of the exemptions, we recommend that you: 
* Adapt card Pay-ins to benefit from exemptions by integrating the new parameters which we will provide.* Coming soon*
* Maintain a robust anti-fraud strategy: A new parameter has appeared in the industry under the name “merchant score”. Depending on your score, you will have access to different levels of exemption. We, therefore, encourage you to keep a robust anti-fraud strategy. 


Your 3DS configuration will change: 
* If you have standard 3DS configuration (50 €):  We will  downgrade it  to 30€
* If you have a custom 3DS configuration: Thanks to our low fraud rate, we will be able to request the “low risk transaction” exemptions for all transactions under 250 euros/pounds. To maximise the chance of qualifying for this exemption, we will release new parameters. 

*N.B. To guarantee the ability to use this exemption for all of our clients, we reserve the right not to use it to maintain our low fraud rate. Therefore, depending on the client's fraud exposure, we will define a threshold (with a maximum of 250 euros) from which we will require the 3DS strong authentication. The threshold system functions in a similar manner to the one we have today. 
Send more data to maximise exemption conversion*

If you use Card Direct Pay-in : 
* You will be required to send us the browser data of the payer *coming on the second quarter of 2020*

If you do offline transactions : 
* We will release a new feature to guarantee all offline transactions. The feature will force SCA at the card registration and link all payment to the original SCA thanks to a token system. All cards registered before this new feature will get a default token, this will guarantee a continuity of service.  


As mentioned, mostly all work will be done by Mangopay, since we act as the PSP and the acquirer for all our merchants and we will manage the complexity of the connection to all PSD2 infrastructure, the fallback/retry scenarios, the exemption demand and management.
Nevertheless, MANGOPAY's clients will have a bigger percentage of SCA on card PayIn.
